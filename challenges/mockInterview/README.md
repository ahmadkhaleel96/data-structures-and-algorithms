# Challenge Summary
 calculate the sum of an array of arrays & Fibonacci Sequence.

## Challenge Description

function that accept an array of arrays then calculate the sum of each array, another function that accepts a number and return an index of that number form a Fibonacci Sequence

## Approach & Efficiency
our approach is very straight forward method of breaking the problem into a smaller blocks, 
Big O (n) for the Fibonacci sequence.
Big O (n^2)
